> create tag bar
> rename tag bar
Rename does not allow for a subprompt for the fourth argument. You must
enter both the old and new tag names at the same time 

Example:
    > rename tag foo bar

Enter ? as any argument help.
> rename tag bar bar2
> show tags
all
bar2
ungrouped
> delete tag bar2
Tag bar2 has been deleted.
