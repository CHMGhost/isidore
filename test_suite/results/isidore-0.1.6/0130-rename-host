> create host foo
> rename host foo
Rename does not allow for a subprompt for the fourth argument. You must
enter both the old and new hostnames at the same time 

Example:
    > rename host foo bar

Enter ? as any argument help.
> rename host foo foo2
> show hosts
foo2
> delete host foo2
Host foo2 has been deleted.
